    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification"> Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.</p>
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>

    <p>To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:<br><strong>Hypertext</strong>: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items<br><strong>Markup</strong>: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format<br><strong>Language</strong>: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.<br>HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" title="CSS Wiki">CSS</a> and <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" title="JavaScript Wiki">JavaScript</a> to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.<br>In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.<br>
      <li>HTML is the skeleton,</li>
      <li>CSS is the skin,</li>
      <li>and JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that brings the structure and the skin to life.</li><br>You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: HTML is the structure of a house, CSS is the interior and exterior decor, and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, and many other functional features that make the house livable.</p>
